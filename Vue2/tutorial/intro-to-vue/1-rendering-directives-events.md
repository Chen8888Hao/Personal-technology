One of my favorite things about Vue is that it takes all of the successful things from other frameworks, and incorporates them without getting disorganized. Some examples that stand out for me:

* A virtual DOM with reactive components that offer the View layer only, props and a Redux-like store similar to React.
* Conditional rendering, and services, similar to Angular.
Inspired by Polymer in part in terms of simplicity and performance, Vue offers a similar development style as HTML, styles, and JavaScript are composed in tandem.

Some benefits I've enjoyed over Vue's competitors: cleaner, more semantic API offerings, slightly better performance than React, no use of polyfills like Polymer, and an isolated, less opinionated view than Angular, which is an MVC.

If you're familiar with React, this will have some similarities. We've escaped into JavaScript in the middle of the content with the mustache template and used a variable, but one difference is we are working with straight up HTML instead of JSX. JSX is pretty easy to work with, but I do think it's nice that I don't have to spend time changing class to className, etc. You'll also notice that this is pretty lightweight to get up and running.
