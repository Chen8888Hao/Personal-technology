        <p>When a v-if block is toggled, Vue will have to perform a partial compilation/teardown process, because the template content inside v-if can also contain data bindings or child components. v-if is "real" conditional rendering because it ensures that event listeners and child components inside the conditional block are properly destroyed and re-created during toggles.</p>
        <p>v-if is also lazy: if the condition is false on initial render, it will not do anything - partial compilation won't start until the condition becomes true for the first time (and the compilation is subsequently cached).</p>
        <p>In comparison, v-show is much simpler - the element is always compiled and preserved, with just simple CSS-based toggling.</p>
        <p>Generally speaking, v-if has higher toggle costs while v-show has higher initial render costs. So prefer v-show if you need to toggle something very often, and prefer v-if if the condition is unlikely to change at runtime.</p>
